### **Project 7: Advanced Kubernetes Projects**  
**Objective**: Explore advanced Kubernetes topics like service mesh, multi-tenancy, and advanced networking to build resilient, secure, and scalable applications.

#### **Tasks**:

1. **Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)**:  
   - How do you install a service mesh (e.g., Istio or Linkerd) in your Kubernetes cluster?  
   - How do you enable service-to-service encryption (mTLS) using a service mesh?  
   - How do you implement traffic splitting (e.g., 80% to v1 and 20% to v2 of your application)?  
   - How do you observe traffic flow between services using a service mesh dashboard?  

2. **Advanced Networking**:  
   - How do you configure Network Policies to restrict communication between namespaces or pods?  
   - How do you set up DNS-based service discovery in Kubernetes?  
   - How do you enable and configure Kubernetes Ingress with HTTPS using Cert-Manager?  

3. **Multi-Tenancy**:  
   - How do you create isolated namespaces for multiple teams with limited resource quotas?  
   - How do you enforce isolation using Kubernetes RBAC and network policies?  
   - What tools can you use to monitor and manage resource usage across tenants?  

4. **Canary and Blue-Green Deployments**:  
   - How do you implement a canary deployment using Kubernetes-native tools or Argo Rollouts?  
   - How do you roll back a failed deployment using Argo Rollouts or Helm?  
   - How do you achieve zero-downtime deployments using a blue-green strategy?  

5. **Observability**:  
   - How do you set up distributed tracing with Jaeger or Zipkin in Kubernetes?  
   - How do you create custom dashboards in Grafana for application-specific metrics?  
   - How do you integrate logs, metrics, and traces into a centralized observability solution?  

6. **Kubernetes Security**:  
   - How do you enable pod security admission (PSA) and enforce best practices?  
   - How do you scan container images for vulnerabilities during the CI/CD pipeline?  
   - How do you enable runtime security using tools like Falco or Aqua Security?  

7. **Custom Operators**:  
   - How do you create a custom Kubernetes operator using the Operator SDK?  
   - How do operators automate complex application lifecycle tasks?  
   - What are some examples of existing operators for databases or storage solutions?  

8. **Chaos Engineering**:  
   - How do you use tools like LitmusChaos or Chaos Mesh to introduce faults into your cluster?  
   - How do you define chaos experiments to test application resilience?  
   - How do you measure and improve recovery times from failures?  

9. **Horizontal and Vertical Pod Autoscaling**:  
   - How do you configure Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA) to automatically adjust resource requests?  
   - How do you combine HPA and VPA for optimal scaling?  
   - How do you simulate load to test autoscaling configurations?  

10. **Edge and Hybrid Deployments**:  
    - How do you deploy Kubernetes workloads to edge nodes or remote clusters?  
    - What is the difference between on-premise, hybrid, and cloud-native Kubernetes setups?  
    - How do you use Kubernetes Federation to manage workloads across multiple clusters?

**Challenge**:  
- Deploy a **resilient, multi-tenant microservices architecture** with the following requirements:  
  - **Service Mesh**: Implement Istio with traffic management and observability.  
  - **Advanced Networking**: Restrict inter-service communication with Network Policies.  
  - **Multi-Tenancy**: Create separate namespaces with resource quotas and RBAC for two teams.  
  - **Security**: Scan images, enforce pod security, and enable mTLS.  
  - **Observability**: Centralized logs, custom metrics, and distributed tracing.  
  - **Resilience Testing**: Use chaos engineering to validate the fault tolerance of the setup.  
  - **CI/CD**: Automate deployments with Canary strategies using Argo Rollouts.

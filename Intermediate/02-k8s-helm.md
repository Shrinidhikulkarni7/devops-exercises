### **Project 6: Intermediate Kubernetes Projects**  
**Objective**: Tackle more advanced Kubernetes concepts, including Helm charts, Ingress controllers, and integrating Kubernetes with CI/CD workflows.

---

#### **Tasks**:

1. **Helm Charts**:  
   - How do you install Helm on your local machine?  
   - How do you use Helm to deploy an existing chart (e.g., `nginx`)?  
   - How do you create your own Helm chart for a basic application?  

2. **Ingress Controllers**:  
   - How do you install and configure an Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX Ingress)?  
   - How do you define an Ingress resource to expose multiple services through a single external endpoint?  

3. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:  
   - How do you create a Kubernetes ServiceAccount for restricted access?  
   - How do you define a Role and RoleBinding to allow specific permissions in a namespace?  

4. **Custom Resources**:  
   - How do you create and use a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)?  
   - What is an operator in Kubernetes, and how do operators manage custom resources?  

5. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**:  
   - How do you enable the metrics server in your cluster?  
   - How do you configure HPA to scale your application based on CPU or memory usage?  

6. **CI/CD Integration**:  
   - How do you set up a pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI) to build a Docker image, push it to a registry, and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster?  
   - How do you use `kubectl` or Helm commands in the pipeline to apply changes to the cluster?  

7. **Secrets Management**:  
   - How do you use tools like HashiCorp Vault or Sealed Secrets to manage Kubernetes secrets securely?  
   - How do you encrypt secrets using Kubernetesâ€™ native tools?  

8. **Monitoring and Alerts**:  
   - How do you install Prometheus and Grafana in your cluster?  
   - How do you set up alerts for high CPU usage or pod failures?  

9. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**:  
   - How do you back up your cluster using tools like Velero?  
   - How do you restore workloads and configurations from a backup?  

10. **Multi-Cluster Deployments**:  
    - What tools can you use to manage workloads across multiple Kubernetes clusters?  
    - How do you deploy the same application to two different clusters using a single Helm chart?

**Challenge**:  
- Build a **production-ready Kubernetes setup** for a complete application:  
  - Use **Helm** to manage your application and dependencies.  
  - Configure an **Ingress Controller** for public access.  
  - Set up **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling** for traffic spikes.  
  - Integrate **Prometheus and Grafana** for monitoring.  
  - Use a **CI/CD pipeline** to automate deployments.  
  - Implement **backup and recovery** with Velero.  
  - Secure secrets using **Sealed Secrets**.  
- Document:  
  - Step-by-step deployment instructions.  
  - How to monitor, scale, and recover the application.  
  - An example CI/CD pipeline configuration.

### **Project 4: Intermediate Docker Projects**  
**Objective**: Build a more complex multi-container application and integrate best practices for orchestration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

---

#### **Tasks**:

1. **Database-Backed Web Application**:  
   - Create a **Node.js/Flask/Django** application that connects to a **PostgreSQL/MySQL** database.  
   - How do you define a database service in `docker-compose.yml`?  
   - How do you pass database connection credentials securely using environment variables?  

2. **Reverse Proxy with NGINX**:  
   - How do you add an **NGINX** service to act as a reverse proxy for your web application?  
   - How do you configure NGINX to forward traffic to multiple app instances?  

3. **Networking**:  
   - How do you create a custom Docker Compose network to isolate your services?  
   - How do you connect external tools (e.g., `pgAdmin` or a browser) to the containers?  

4. **Data Persistence**:  
   - How do you set up volumes to persist database and application data?  
   - How do you verify the data persists after container restarts?  

5. **Health Checks**:  
   - How do you add health checks in your `docker-compose.yml` to monitor the status of services?  
   - How can you make dependent services wait until the database is fully initialized?  

6. **Service Scaling**:  
   - How do you scale the application service to handle increased load?  
   - How can you balance traffic among scaled instances using NGINX?  

7. **Monitoring and Logging**:  
   - How do you integrate a logging service (e.g., **ELK Stack** or **Fluentd**) into your setup?  
   - How do you monitor your services using a tool like **Prometheus** or **Grafana**?  

8. **Backup and Restore**:  
   - How do you take a backup of the database running in a container?  
   - How do you restore the database from the backup into a new container?  

9. **Build Optimization**:  
   - How do you optimize a multi-stage Dockerfile for your application to reduce image size?  
   - How do you cache dependencies during the build process for faster builds?  

10. **Environment-Specific Configurations**:  
    - How do you use different `docker-compose.override.yml` files for development, testing, and production?  
    - How do you test your setup in multiple environments?

**Challenge**:  
- Build a **three-tier application** using Docker Compose:  
  - **Frontend**: A React or Angular app served via NGINX.  
  - **Backend**: A Flask or Node.js API that processes requests.  
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL with persistent storage.  
- Include:  
  - **Load balancing** for the backend with NGINX.  
  - **Health checks** for all services.  
  - **Logging** using the ELK Stack.  
  - **Monitoring** with Grafana.  
- Document how the services communicate and how to scale each tier independently.

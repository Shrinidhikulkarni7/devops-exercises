### **Project 2: Getting Started with Docker**  
**Objective**: Learn the basics of Docker by solving tasks related to containerizing an application and working with images and containers.  

---

#### **Tasks**:

1. **Docker Installation**:  
   - How do you install Docker on your system?  
   - How do you verify that Docker is installed correctly?  

2. **Docker Images**:  
   - What command lists all the Docker images on your system?  
   - How do you pull an image (e.g., `nginx`) from Docker Hub?  

3. **Running Containers**:  
   - How do you run a container using the `nginx` image?  
   - How can you map a container's port (e.g., `80`) to a port on your local machine (e.g., `8080`)?  

4. **Container Management**:  
   - How do you list all running containers?  
   - How do you stop a running container?  
   - How do you restart a container that has been stopped?  

5. **Custom Dockerfile**:  
   - How do you create a `Dockerfile` to containerize a simple Python script that prints "Hello, World!"?  
   - How do you build an image from your `Dockerfile`?  

6. **Tagging Images**:  
   - How do you tag your Docker image with a version (e.g., `myapp:1.0`)?  
   - Why is tagging important?  

7. **Sharing Images**:  
   - How do you push an image to your Docker Hub account?  
   - How do you pull an image that someone else has shared?  

8. **Inspecting Containers**:  
   - What command shows detailed information about a running container?  
   - How do you check the logs of a container?  

9. **Container Cleanup**:  
   - How do you remove a stopped container?  
   - How do you delete an image from your system?  

---

**Challenge**:  
- Write a simple Node.js application that serves "Hello, Docker!" on port 3000.  
- Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.  
- Run the application in a Docker container, mapping it to port 8080 on your local machine.  
- Push the image to Docker Hub and share the link.
